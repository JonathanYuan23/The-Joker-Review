                        <i>The Dark Knight</i>: It was 2008 when Heath Ledger playing the role of the Joker, outshined
                        Christian Bale, the Batman, in his <i>own</i> movie. A battle between disciple of malevolence,
                        and disciple of justice; but this time, evil wins. Having watched it many years prior, only now
                        have I begun to appreciate the <i>absolute</i> genius behind Ledger’s performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ledger bent the movie to his will, becoming an omnipresent shadow of dread over a soulless
                        Gotham City. The character who slithers his tongue out the corners of his mouth, like a cobra
                        licking his scars—just like his hysterical hyena laugh—left audiences unsettled and gripped with
                        panic. His makeup is smeared and sloppy, as if symbolizing his freakish nature, while his hair
                        is wild and disheveled—the spitting image of unhinged.
                    </p>
                    <p>When asked why he chose Ledger for the role, Christopher Nolan’s response was this:</p>
                    <p>“He’s fearless”</p>

                    <p>
                        Ledger’s performance was a result of his extreme dedication. In preparation for filming, he
                        locked himself into a hotel room for six weeks, where he intensely studied
                        <i>every single</i> comic that Joker appeared in. Taking inspiration from Malcolm McDowell’s
                        violent psychopathy in <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, he worked day and night on the finer tics and
                        quirks of his character.

                            watching—he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it! Turns to me, and he says,
                            “Why so serious, son?” Comes at me with the knife…“ Why so serious?” He sticks the blade in
                            my mouth… “Let’s put a smile on that face!”

                        One of my favourite aspects of Ledger’s Joker is the ambiguity in his origin story which he
                        tells to his victims. Depending on who he’s about to kill, he offers different variations of
                        this twisted and traumatizing tale—to Gambol, the story of an abusive father wielding a blade;
                        to Rachel, the story of a deranged marriage which drove him into madness—for his victims to
                        sympathize with before their slaughter. In my opinion, it’s these subtle mannerisms which
                        elevated his character into the realm of realism, of true insanity: it’s the icing on the cake.

                        With a cruel and unnerving Glasgow smile, Ledger’s Joker is a stark contrast to Jack Nicholson’s
                        <i>inelegant</i> interpretation in 1989. His phenomenal acting captures the essence of Joker’s
                        character—spontaneous, loose cannon… a monster, fearless and peerless. The Joker loves chaos,
                        lives for chaos, revels in chaos, thrusting innocent people into deeper and deeper and deeper
                        chaos…

                    <p>
                        Gotham City: a corrupt and perilous jungle, serves as the ideal setting for Joker’s playground.
                        Throughout the film, he conducts a number of “purges”, in an attempt to validate his belief that
                        human nature is inherently rooted in violence. He rigs explosives on two ferries in the middle
                        of Gotham river, and encourages the passengers of each to decide the fate of the other. He
                        threatens to blow up a hospital, unless someone kills the accountant planning to expose Batman’s
                        identity. He films a gruesome hostage video, goading Batman into turning himself in with the
                        ultimatum of even more people dying.

                        Furthermore, Hans Zimmer’s compositions are a haunting parallel to Joker’s rampage. I still get
                        the chills when I listen to the Joker Theme <i>Why So Serious?</i>. It begins with whispers, but
                        then becomes unstable and starts arising into something much more sinister. An ominous buzzing
                        noise, which quickly swells into a high pitched siren, as if warning you… that something
                        dangerous is coming. Frantic flashes of violin; in the background, the tortured and jarring
                        sound of razor blade on string scratching at your eardrums. Then sudden bursts of electric
                        guitar, which fade into thundering bass as quickly as they came. And when all the sounds
                        dissipate, and we think that it’s finally over, Hans Zimmer comes back in an explosion even
                        crazier than before. The theme is a perfect encapsulation of Joker’s character: spontaneous,
                        unnerving and shocking to the core.

                        There’s not likely to be a more palpable, stimulating, paralyzing, and culturally-impactful
                        supervillain performance for decades to come. Heath Ledger breathed life into his Joker,
                        breaking away from the conventional “superhero movie” where all goes well, and setting the tone
                        for a darker, grittier, more mature sub-genre.
